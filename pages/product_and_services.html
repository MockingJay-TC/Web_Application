                            A treasury bill (T-Bills) is a short-term investment product (from 91 days to 365 days)
                            backed
                            by the Bank of Ghana on behalf of the Government. When you buy one, you are essentially
                            lending
                            money to the government of Ghana.

                            <h5>Offer Details</h5>
                            Treasury bills are one of the safest forms of investment in the world because they are
                            backed by
                            the Ghana government and are considered risk-free. They are also used by many other
                            governments
                            throughout the world.

                            Upon maturity, the government will repay the amount it borrowed (your investment) with the
                            determined interest rate given at the time of the investment. The interest rate payable
                            depends
                            on how long you lent your money for.

                            Treasury bills are risk free.
                            You may roll over both the principal and interest or continue with the investment (roll over
                            the
                            principal) and take your interest.
                            Treasury Bills can easily be converted into cash.
                            Interest on T-Bills is higher than bank savings account rates.
                            No applicable transactions cost.
                            T-Bills can be used as collateral.
                            There is no limit to how much one can buy. It depends on how much you are willing and able
                            to
                            buy.
